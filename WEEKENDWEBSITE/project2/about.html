            <h2>Looking for the Best Products</h2>
            <p>Hi,I’m the founder of the peekabo Company platform, the Perfect Dress Collection, Bump to Baby Dresses and Darcy Rose Meaningful Jewellery.
                    I am passionate about helping you look amazing and feel confident, no matter what age, size or shape you are. For all of the dress collections I have designed, I have obsessed over cut, detail and fabric to ensure a beautiful luxurious fit every time. No matter what stage of life you are in, we want to become that go-to dress in your wardrobe that never lets you down, the dress you know you’ll always feel great in.</p>
            <p>When I got home, I set out to design & create the ultimate range of figure-enhancing dresses for women of all sizes. I decided to call the company the Perfect Dress Company as the dresses were going to be perfect. The first range that we launched in 2019 was our luxe range of Figure Flattering Dresses which are dresses with clever tailoring designed to slim, sculpt and contour your shape in seconds. The full range of Figure Flattering Dresses take you from everyday office wear to cocktails with friends, date nights to weddings, and any occasion where you want to look and feel amazing.</p>
            <p>The next range surfaced in early 2020 when a few of my friends were pregnant and it took me back to that holiday where my maternity wear was not only uncomfortable it was really unflattering too. I realised when I was pregnant, I was spending lots of money on maternity wear I would never wear again. There were no stylish, flattering dresses I bought which I could wear afterwards too</p> 
            <p>Premium quality materials, excellent fits and functional details are what make MEYER trousers so special. The collections are developed in Reichshof-Denklingen in Bergischen Land near Cologne, with years of experience and a confident eye for style and design. Exclusive use of high-quality materials and outer fabrics, processed by renowned European suppliers and weavers - principally from Germany, Italy and Portugal. The soft and pleasant feel of every pair of MEYER trousers reflects our consideration, when it comes to choosing fabrics. All jeans and cotton trousers are pre-washed in our special laundry system, so they don’t shrink when you wash them at home.</p>
             <p>We don’t just pay attention to outstanding quality, we also accept our responsibilities as manufacturers. Adherence to international social and ecological standards in our European production facility, is regularly checked by FLO-CERT, the world’s largest independent social certifier. Our production facility meets the criteria of the STANDARD 100 by OEKO-Tex® and bears the internationally recognised FAIRTRADE logo. We’re committed to our responsibility when it comes to the environment, for example our laundry system has an integrated water preparation plant. Quality, ethics and a good price are not mutually exclusive.</p>
            <p>We manufacture exclusively in our European production facility near Brașov in Romania. Modern CAD cutting technology and the craft-based skill and passion of our employees make for precise cuts. Every step in the process confirms what makes MEYER trousers so special, caring processes and the highest degree of precision in processing - whether by machine or by hand. Permanent checks by our experts guarantee that each trouser is of perfect quality, because it’s only in the interplay between precise technology and the instinct of each individual, that original MEYER trousers are born.</p>
